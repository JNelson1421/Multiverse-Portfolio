## Acknowledgement
I wish to express my deep appreciation to both American Express & Multiverse for providing a pathway into a career that once seemed out of reach without a traditional college degree. A special thank you goes to Jonathan Jacka for his exemplary role as a coach and mentor. My current position is greatly attributed to his guidance and support.
