## My Multiverse Frontend Project
### Overview of the project
This project was completed as a module project for Multiverse. The goal was to showcase my ability to use frontend technologies, such as React and React Bootstrap, as well as integrate 3rd party APIs. I created this based on my passion for the sport of baseball. The website showcases all 32 MLB teams with a rotating carousel that displays the logo of every team. It pulls from a 3rd-party API to display statistical leaders in two batting categories: at bats and home runs for the 2022 season. The website also features a search function that allows users to search for any active player. A card will display for the searched player, which is clickable. When clicked, it will present their personal batting statistics from the 2022 season. The website also features a functional light/dark mode button.

## Competencies
### Job Function 2.3
- Can develop effective user interfaces
#### Situation where I Demonstrated the Job Function:
- During my time with Multiverse, I was assigned a module project which aimed to gauge my capability in using frontend technologies. The challenge was to create a dynamic and user-friendly website, which was an opportunity 
  for me to demonstrate my skills in developing effective user interfaces. Given my passion for baseball, I chose to design a website that highlighted the MLB teams and provided comprehensive statistics for 
  baseball enthusiasts.
#### Actions Taken to Accomplish the Goal:
- Technological Integration: I employed React as the primary frontend framework, ensuring the UI was both responsive and dynamic. React Bootstrap further enhanced the site's design and interactivity, providing a polished 
  look and feel.
- Dynamic Content Rendering: To make the website data-rich, I integrated a 3rd party API that pulled real-time statistics for MLB teams. This ensured the site wasn't just static but provided up-to-date information, 
  keeping it relevant and engaging.
- Interactive Features: I incorporated several user-centric features:
  A rotating carousel that exhibited logos of all 32 MLB teams, offering a visual treat for the users.
  A search functionality, allowing users to swiftly locate active players. Upon searching, a card showcasing the player would appear.
  The clickable card feature, where users could delve deeper into individual players' batting statistics for the 2022 season, ensuring detailed data access for users.
#### Results and Emphasis on Learning Outcomes:
- Skill Enhancement: This project deepened my understanding of frontend technologies. Integrating 3rd party APIs bolstered my proficiency in fetching and rendering dynamic content in real-time.
- Positive Feedback: The interface's seamless navigation and rich data content garnered positive feedback, validating the effectiveness of the user interface. The search feature, in particular, was appreciated for its 
  responsiveness and utility.
#### Connecting the Competency to This Project:
- User-Centric Approach: The website was not just a representation of my passion for baseball but was tailored to cater to baseball enthusiasts' interests and inquiries. The search feature, rotating carousel, and 
  clickable cards ensured users found what they were looking for with ease.
- Seamless Integration: Leveraging React and React Bootstrap showcased my competency in using leading frontend technologies to develop interfaces that are not just visually appealing but also dynamic and user-friendly.


### Job Function 3.3
- Can link code to data sets
#### Situation where I Demonstrated the Job Function
- In a module project for Multiverse, I was faced with the intricate task of linking dynamic data sets to my code. I sought to develop a baseball-themed website, which not only represented my passion for the sport but 
  also required real-time, accurate data to be fetched and displayed. This situation challenged me to not just create an interactive website but also ensure it was consistently updated with live statistics from the world 
  of baseball.
#### Actions Taken to Accomplish the Goal:
- Integrating Frontend Technologies: I utilized React as my primary frontend framework, capitalizing on its features to create an interactive and responsive user interface. React Bootstrap further refined the site's 
  appearance, ensuring a professional aesthetic.
- API Linking: Understanding the importance of accurate and real-time data for a sports-themed website, I integrated a 3rd party API. This API was responsible for fetching live statistics related to two critical batting 
  categories: at bats and home runs for the 2022 season.
- Dynamic Content Creation: I established a seamless link between the code and the fetched data sets. This allowed the website to showcase a rotating carousel of MLB team logos and a search feature. The search feature let 
  users look up active players, with the search results presenting an interactive card displaying individual player statistics.
#### Results and Emphasis on Learning Outcomes:
- Technical Proficiency: The successful implementation of real-time data into the website significantly boosted my confidence in working with APIs and linking them to frontend frameworks.
- Real-time Data Display: With the successful linkage of data sets to the code, the website was always updated, showcasing the latest statistics from the 2022 season. This dynamic feature was a key highlight and a 
  testament to the successful merging of code with data sets.
#### Connecting the Competency to This Project:
- Relevance and Accuracy: A sports website thrives on the accuracy and timeliness of its data. By successfully linking the code to real-time baseball statistics, I ensured that users were always presented with the most 
  up-to-date information.
- Dynamic Interactivity: The search feature and clickable cards were not just static components; they were intrinsically tied to the live data, highlighting my ability to intertwine frontend functionalities with dynamic 
  data sources.
