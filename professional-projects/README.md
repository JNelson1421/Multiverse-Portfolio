# My First Professional Project for American Express
## Overview of the project
My time with American Express has revolved around one main focus, a portal for our business users to manage employee credit cards and spending. I have spent my time completing stories pertaining to this portal for months now and will continue to for the forseeable future as we prepare to rollout its features to markets worldwide. My first focus was the creation of two fully functional banners that would display on a user's homepage when accessing the portal. Each of the banners rotates on its own every 10 seconds, with functional navigation to go to the next slide, and previous slides. The banners also include a play/pause button and a functional delete button that deletes a message when the user no longer wants it to appear. One of my latest stories pertaining to the banners was to remove links from within the messages inside the banners. Our banners contain a button in the top right corner, and if certain criteria were met, would also populate a button with link within the message of the banner. Our design team requested that the link in the message no longer populate regardless of the scenario so that there would be more space within the banner. I successfully filtered out all of the links within the banner message as per their request and deployed the changes to production on my own. This was my second time deploying my changes to production completely by myself without the assistance of one of my collegues. Another area that I have personally worked on is our notification center within the portal. I was tasked with overhauling the formatting of the table, including creating blue icons that would appear next to new messages, indicating that the message has not been read yet. This is just a brief overview of what I have done with my time at American Express. Like I have previously mentioned, for security reasons, I am unable to share any code snippets, my apologies.

## Competencies
### Job Function 2.6
- Can translate wireframes into User Interfaces
- When working on the banners and notification table, I was following a wireframe created by our UX team
#### Actions I took to accomplish this included:
- Interpretation of Wireframes: I began by analyzing the wireframes given to me, to understand the core features and design elements that were to be represented in the final user interface. I studied each segment,         
  ensuring that the wireframe's functionality and visual aspects were comprehended entirely.
- Designing the Elements: Using the wireframes as guides, I developed two banners. I ensured that the banners maintained consistency with the project's theme while being visually appealing. For the notifications table, I    focused on readability and usability, designing it in a way that users can easily navigate through and understand the notifications presented.
#### The results of my actions for my team and my own learning included:
- Enhanced Team Workflow: By translating the wireframes into user interfaces, the developers had a clear vision of what needed to be built. This reduced ambiguity and increased the efficiency of our development process.
- Personal Learning: Throughout this project, I enhanced my understanding of the user interface's importance in conveying the functionality and purpose of an application or webpage. I learned how to prioritize design 
  elements, ensuring that the most important aspects were prominent and accessible.
#### How the competency connects to my project:
- Vision from the Beginning: The wireframes served as our blueprint. By accurately interpreting and transforming them, we ensured that the original vision of the designers was maintained and brought to life in the final   
  interface.
- Banners and Notifications Table: These were the primary elements of our project. They represented the core functionalities and visual appeals we wanted to offer our users. By efficiently translating them from the 
  wireframe, I showcased my competency in understanding and materializing design concepts into user-friendly interfaces.

### Job Function 4.3
- Is able to build, manage and deploy code into the relevant environment
#### Actions I took to accomplish this included:
- Code Development: After the design phase was completed with the two banners and notifications table, I initiated the coding process. Leveraging languages and frameworks suitable for the project, I transformed the visual 
  designs into functional components.
- Version Control: Using tools like Git, I maintained regular commits of the code to ensure that every change was tracked. This also allowed me to collaborate with team members, integrating their contributions without 
  conflicts.
- Testing Environments: Before deployment, I set up staging environments to test the functionality and appearance of the banners and notifications table. This ensured that they worked seamlessly and appeared correctly 
  across different devices and browsers.
- Deployment: Using deployment tools, I pushed the code to the relevant production environment, ensuring that the transition was smooth and the components integrated seamlessly with the existing infrastructure.
#### The results of my actions for my team and my own learning included:
- Efficient Collaboration: The systematic approach to version control allowed for seamless collaboration among team members. Everyone was always on the same page, with minimal conflicts or duplications.
- Robust Functionality: Through rigorous testing in staging environments, I ensured that the banners and notifications table functioned effectively and consistently, avoiding potential post-deployment issues.
- Personal Growth: This project reinforced the importance of a well-structured deployment pipeline, deepening my understanding of the intricacies of production environments and the potential pitfalls to avoid.
#### How the competency connects to my project:
- From Visual to Functional: The banners and notifications table were not just visual elements; they required coding to function properly and integrate with the system. My skills ensured that the designs were not just   
  visually appealing but also operationally effective.
- Ensuring Stability: Deployment isn't just about pushing code; it's about ensuring that the application or website remains stable and functional post-deployment. The notifications table, for instance, was a critical 
  feature, and any disruption could impact user experience. My competency ensured a hassle-free deployment.
